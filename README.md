# stuff
Random and mostly useless stuff I write before going to sleep.

I may or may not keep a brief description of what's in here in this README, but only if I feel like it.
Hopefully the code itself will be decent, but that's about it. The small things may not even have tests.

As a general rule, these are just excuses to play with a specific language or with a problem that feels like fun. Sometimes that means reinventing the wheel, and sometimes 

## Automaze.py
A simple dungeon generator in Python. Can be run "as is" I think, and outputs to the console.
Results may be weird depending on console settings; I have to set the line height to 0.5 on OS X so that
the boxy characters I use to "draw" look kinda square and connect across lines. Yeah, it's kinda lame.

(Thanks, by the way!)
