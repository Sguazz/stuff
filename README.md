# stuff
Random and mostly useless stuff I write before going to sleep.

I may or may not keep a brief description of what's in here in this README, but only if I feel like it.
Hopefully the code itself will be decent, but that's about it. The small things may not even have tests.

As a general rule, these are just excuses to play with a specific language or with a problem that feels like fun. Sometimes that means reinventing the wheel, and sometimes 

## Automaze.py
A simple dungeon generator in Python. Can be run "as is" I think, and outputs to the console.
Results may be weird depending on console settings; I have to set the line height to 0.5 on OS X so that
the boxy characters I use to "draw" look kinda square and connect across lines. Yeah, it's kinda lame.

Inspired by (read: basically stolen from) http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/  
(Thanks, by the way!)

## Scales.hs
I've (finally!) started to look into musical modes! They're pretty straightforward to compute, but a little messier to visualize on a guitar neck. So this thing prints out a bunch of info about an arbitrary key/mode combination, including a rudimentary representation of a guitar neck.

I'm not sure it'll actually help me to learn anything, because visualizations on a console really can only be so good - I think I'd rather get an app on my phone and be done with it. 

Then again, it's as good an excuse to play with Haskell as any, I guess - I'm still kinda new at it, so yeah. Sometimes I enjoy mixing together the different things I'm trying to learn.

(Which reminds me - I fear the code for this thing wouldn't be considered particularly pretty by those who know anything about Haskell. Sorry. I try.)
